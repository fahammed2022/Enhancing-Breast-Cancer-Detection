<h1>Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning</h1>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern for women. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. This project focuses on developing a robust breast cancer detection system leveraging machine learning algorithms, specifically K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Neural Network classifiers. The goal is to create an accurate and efficient binary classification model for identifying breast cancer cases.
